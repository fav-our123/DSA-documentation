# DSA-DOCUMENTATION
This is where I built my portfolio while taking the Data Analytics course with the Incubator hub in conjunction with DSA. Starting out as a self learner, this program helped to hone my skills, ranging from Ms-Excel to Power BI.
## PROJECT TOPIC 1: AMAZON PRODUCT REVIEW ANALYSIS
### PROJECT OVERVIEW
This Data Analysis Project seeks to provide e-commerce solutions to sellers on Amazon. Using Excel, I analysed product and customer review data to generate insights that guides product improvement, marketing strategies, and customer engagement. Using the various parameters of the data, I answered several questions and plotted pivot tables. The cleaned datasets and pivot outputs were used to build an all emcompassing dasboard to aid visualization.
#### DATA SOURCES
The dataset, as provided by DSA, contains information scraped from Amazon product pages, including product details and customer engagement, with each row representing a unique product. The total records numbered 1,465 rows with 16 coulumns.
##### TOOL USED 
- MS-EXCEL for:
- Data Cleaning and manipulation
- Data Visualization

##### ANALYSIS INSIGHTS
1. What is the average discount percentage by product category?
2. How many products are listed under each category?
3. What is the total number of reviews per category?
4. Which products have the highest average ratings?
5. What is the average actual price vs the discounted price by category?
6. Which products have the highest number of reviews?
7. How many products have a discount of 50% or more?
8. What is the distribution of product ratings (e.g., how many products are rated 3.0,
4.0, etc.)?
9. What is the total potential revenue (actual_price × rating_count) by category?
10. What is the number of unique products per price range bucket (e.g., <$200, $200-$500, >$500)
11. How does the rating relate to the level of discount?
12. How many products have fewer than 1,000 reviews?
13. Which categories have products with the highest discounts?
14. Identify the top 5 products in terms of rating and number of reviews combined.
