# DSA-DOCUMENTATION
This is where I built my portfolio while taking the Data Analytics course with the Incubator hub in conjunction with DSA. Starting out as a self learner, this program helped to hone my skills, ranging from Ms-Excel to Power BI.
## PROJECT TOPIC 1: AMAZON PRODUCT REVIEW ANALYSIS
### PROJECT OVERVIEW
This Data Analysis Project seeks to provide e-commerce solutions to sellers on Amazon. Using Excel, I analysed product and customer review data to generate insights that guides product improvement, marketing strategies, and customer engagement. Using the various parameters of the data, I answered several questions and plotted pivot tables. The cleaned datasets and pivot outputs were used to build an all emcompassing dasboard to aid visualization.
